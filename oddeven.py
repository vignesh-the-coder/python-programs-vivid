#User function Template for python3

# Given a positive integer x. Your task is to check, if it is even or odd 
# (Any number that gives zero as remainder when divided by 2 is an even number)

# Example 1:

# Input:
# x = 4
# Output:
# Even
# Example 2:

# Input:
# x = 5
# Output:
# Odd
# Your Task:

# Your task is to complete the function checkEvenOdd(), 
#which returns True (In python, True starts with caps T) if the number is even,
#else return False (In Python, False starts with caps F).

# Note: Python functions, just like variables, don't have a datatype keyword preceding the identifier.
