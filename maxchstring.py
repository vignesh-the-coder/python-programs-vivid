# String with Maximum Alphabet CH

# The program must accept two string values $1 and $2 containing only alphabets and an alphabet CH as

# the input. The program must print the string which has the maximum occurrences of the CH. 
#If both $1 arm

# 52 have the same number of occurrences of the CH then the program must print the first string $1 as the

# output. Note: At least one of the string values will always contain the alphabet CH.

# Boundary Condition(s): 3 <= Length of S1, S2 <= 100

# input Format: The first line contains S1. The second line contains $2. The third line contains CH.

# Output Format: The first line contains $1 or $2.

# Example input/Output 1:

# Input: world hello

# Output: hello

# Explanation:

# The alphabet CH is L In the string word, the number of occurrences of the alphabet I is 1. 
#In the string he o, the number of occurrences of the alphabet I is 2. So the maximum(larger) count is 2. 
#Hence the output is hello
